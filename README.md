# Water-Quality-Prediction
This study focuses on forecasting Water quality index and Water quality classification through  application of different machine learning techniques  aiming to enhance predictions that are crucial for industrial operations, public health, and environmental management.
we investigated the effectiveness of different machine learning models for emotion classification from text including HNB, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNeighbours, SVM, Adaboost.For each algorithm we provide a detailed examination of its performance through key visualization and metrics, including accuracy score, potability of dataset , Classification report,recall F1-score and confusion matrix.
